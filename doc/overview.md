This cookbook installs PHPIPAM on an Ubuntu 14.04 system.

It can be used to install a standalone app/db multi-role system on a single
system, or configured to install the application and database components on
separate servers.

NOTE: only specific versions of PHPIPAM are supported. We start with version
1.2, and will probably be adding 1.3 along with upgrade options eventually.

You can view all the PHPIPAM documentation at https://phpipam.net/.
